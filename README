# Introduction
This is something I made when I moved out into my own place and needed a way to manage my budget.

It is currently a command-line tool, but I may eventually add a GUI.

# Instructions
Simply set your income, then add your monthly expenses/bills. You can do this every month, or only once if your expenses are the same every month.

The program then calculates a budget. This is the money you have left over after all the bills are paid..
The budget represents the amount of money you REALLY have - I.E. that you can spend on fun stuff and on groceries.

Add a payment every time you buy something to keep track of how much money you still have left :)

The program tracks how much money you have left at the end of each month. When you move onto the next month,
the program will add the money you had left in the previous month, to the budget in your current month.
This additional budget is called "leftovers" within the manager.
That way, if you save well, your budget will grow :)
